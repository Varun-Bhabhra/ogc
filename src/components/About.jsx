              At the heart of our Ganesh Puja Committee is the unwavering belief
              that devotion should never be hindered by financial concerns. Our
              esteemed president, Ganesh Agarwal, embodies this principle with
              his progressive and inclusive vision. His guiding philosophy,
              encapsulated in the slogan "jo lagega, lagega," reflects his
              commitment to ensuring that every aspect of our Puja is conducted
              with the utmost devotion, regardless of the cost.
              <br />
              <br />
              Ganesh Agarwal's vision is simple yet profound: when it comes to
              worship and the celebration of Lord Ganesha, no expense should
              stand in the way of our collective devotion. He firmly believes
              that the true value of our Puja lies not in the money spent but in
              the sincerity of our hearts. Under his leadership, our committee
              is dedicated to creating an atmosphere where every devotee can
              connect with the divine, free from the burdens of financial worry.
